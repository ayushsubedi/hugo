              Data literacy to enhance data-driven decision-making
            </p>
            <!-- <p class="subtitle is-6">
              Data literacy can support Nepal government’s priorities by
              fostering an environment where citizens have the knowledge to use
              data for evidence-based decision making and to increase
              transparency and accountability in public service delivery. Data
              literacy can also potentially lead to innovative solutions that
              promote economic growth and achieve better living conditions of
              people. To this end, World Bank is organizing Data Literacy
              training for academics, CSOs and members of media, and hackathon
              for diverse group of stakeholders to:
              <li class="subtitle is-6">
                increase their data analysis capacity for data driven decision
                making and

              <li class="subtitle is-6">
                develop and pilot data-driven projects.

              Nepal Data Literacy Program is designed to catalyze stronger
              data-driven decision-making by government and non-government
              actors (mass media, civil society, and academia) through targeted
              Data Literacy and data systems strengthening. The program
              comprises a modular, customizable pedagogy to support both
              technical skills-building and efforts to inaugurate a ‘culture of
              data use’ among targeted stakeholders.
              <br /><br />
              Data, more specifically, government data can play an instrumental
              role in helping Nepal government advance its development
              objectives and its aim of achieving double-digit growth rate,
              foster partnership among various government agencies, and enable
              and environment for robust tracking and monitoring of progress.
